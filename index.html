                <h2>Why I Created This Website</h2>

                <p>This website was created to help protect people from cyber threats and online scams. I built it because I care about keeping our communities safe â€” and I wanted to make online security simple and accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.</p>

                    <h3>The Story That Changed Everything</h3>
                    <p>My inspiration came from witnessing someone I care about â€” a neighbor â€” fall victim to online scams. She trusted what she saw online, believed the wrong sources, and lost both money and personal information as a result. Watching her experience was heartbreaking, and it made me realize how vulnerable people can be in today's digital world.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>The reality is that cyber scams are becoming more sophisticated every single day. Scammers have evolved â€” they're now experts at impersonating legitimate companies, creating convincing fake websites, and using psychological manipulation to trick even the most cautious individuals.</p>
