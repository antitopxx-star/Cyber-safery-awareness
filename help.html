            <h2>If You Think You're Being Hacked</h2>
            <p>If you notice suspicious activity or believe someone is accessing your accounts or devices without permission, act quickly but calmly. Follow these prioritized steps to limit damage and begin recovery.</p>

            <h3>Immediate actions (first 15 minutes)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disconnect from the internet:</strong> Turn off Wiâ€‘Fi and unplug Ethernet. If the device shows active remote control, power it off.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a trusted device:</strong> From a different, secure device (not the possibly compromised one), change passwords for your email, bank, and key accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable 2FA:</strong> Turn on twoâ€‘factor authentication for accounts that support it to stop attackers from reusing stolen passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact your bank:</strong> If financial information or transfers are involved, notify your bank or card issuer immediately and freeze accounts if necessary.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Next steps (hours â€” day)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scan for malware:</strong> Run an upâ€‘toâ€‘date antivirus/antimalware scan. If you suspect deep compromise, consider professional malware removal or a factory reset.</li>
                <li><strong>Check account activity:</strong> Review recent logins, connected devices and account recovery options (backup emails, phone numbers) and remove unfamiliar entries.</li>
                <li><strong>Preserve evidence:</strong> Take screenshots, save emails, and note times and phone numbers â€” these help when reporting or working with support.</li>
                <li><strong>Report the incident:</strong> File a report with your local police and report scams to the Canadian Antiâ€‘Fraud Centre or your countryâ€™s equivalent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Signs of compromise</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unexpected password reset emails you didn't request.</li>
                <li>Unknown devices or sessions listed in account settings.</li>
                <li>Unusual outgoing messages sent from your accounts.</li>
                <li>Ransom or access popups, or programs you didn't install.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to get professional help</h3>
            <p>If you lost money, personal identity documents, or the device holds sensitive work data, contact local law enforcement and consider professional IT/forensic help or an identity-theft protection service.</p>
